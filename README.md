# technical-documentation-page-fCC

This is the third Certification Project I coded for the freeCodeCamp Certification in Responsive Web Design. It is a JavaScript documentation page responsive to the device displayed on.

It includes:

- **technical doc page.html**: the html file with the content of the technical documentation page.
- **styles.css**: styles sheet.
